[Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free, automated, and open
certificate authority by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), that can
provide SSL/TLS certificates. Here is how you can integrate it and use it with
**gae-init**:

Use the [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-shell/docs/) to
execute the following docker commands:

```bash
docker run -it -p 443:443 -p 80:80 \
  -v "$(pwd)/ssl-keys:/etc/letsencrypt" \
  quay.io/letsencrypt/letsencrypt:latest \
  -a manual certonly
```

After following the instructions and filling the URL and email for the custom
domain, you should be able to get the **challenge** and the **response** back.
Copy/paste them into the **Admin > SSL** to the respected fields on the
deployed version of the app.

As a final step we need to upload the certificiats to App Engine, but before
that convert private key to a compatible format (replace `www.example.com` with
your actual domain):

```bash
sudo openssl rsa -inform pem \
  -in live/www.example.com/privkey.pem \
  -outform pem > live/www.example.com/privkey_fixed.pem
```

Copy the contents of `cert.pem` & `fixed.pem` and paste them into the App
Engine settings for [SSL Certificats](https://console.developers.google.com/appengine/settings/certificates):

```bash
sudo cat ~/ssl-keys/live/www.example.com/cert.pem
sudo cat ~/ssl-keys/live/www.example.com/privkey_fixed.pem
```

Setup the custom domain and make sure that you have `secure: always` in your
[`app.yaml`](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/blob/master/main/app.yaml#L49).
