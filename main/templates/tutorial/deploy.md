Make sure that you have created a new application on
[App Engine](http://appengine.google.com)
and the name of the application is updated in the `app.yaml` file that is
located in the `main` directory.

To deploy your application execute the following command from the root directory:

```bash
$ gulp deploy
```

Test your application by adding new contacts online!
