    If you have some experience already building web applications, you are aware of
    the fact that there are some common tasks you have to do before you get started.
    You have to set up a project with a file structure, grab the latest libraries,
    copy usefull code snippets from old projects, or rewrite them, setup a sign in
    mechanism and other repeated boring stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project solves exactly that problem. It comes with
    the most common stuff that you need in order to create a modern web application.
    No more wasted time on dealing with tools and configurations.
    You can start working on your next big thing, right away!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>gae-init</strong> is always up to date with the latest
    libraries and following the best programming practices. Do you like it clean?
    We love it! We religiously follow coding conventions for clarity and consistency.

    I'm <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PanayiotisLipiridis">Lipis</a>
    and I'm the guy behind this project. Yes I've finished the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction">Getting Started Tutorial</a>
    and after that I've read most of the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/">manual</a>.
    This project wouldn't be here without my old fellas,
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimZadorozhny/">Mr. Tim</a> and
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChristosTopaloudis/">Mr. Chris</a>
    that contributed with ideas, code, RedBulls, other stuff
    and the pretty awesome logo that was made by another good fella,
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KostasSymeonidis/">Mr. Kostas</a>.
    Also special thanks goes to <a href="https://github.com/gmist">gmist</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/joernhees">joernhees</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/mdxs">mdxs</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/xcash">xcash</a> and
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanlindmark">stefanlindmark</a>
    for contributing with their time, code and ideas.

    Some may ask why not using something that is already there like
    <a href="https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate">gae-boilerplate</a>
    or <a href="https://github.com/kamalgill/flask-appengine-template">flask-appengine-template</a>.
    The answer is that, among other many things,
    <a href="https://github.com/coto/gae-boilerplate/blob/master/bp_content/themes/default/templates/base.html">gae-boilerplate's base.html</a>
    is huge, unreadable and a bit chaotic compare to
    <a href="https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/blob/master/main/templates/base.html">gae-init's base.html</a>
    and that <em>flask-appengine-template</em> doesn't even have the pretty useful user sign-in.
