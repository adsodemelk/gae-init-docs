You can leave the web server running while you develop your application. The web server watches for changes in your source files and reloads them if necessary.

1. Try it now: Leave the web server running, then edit `main/templates/welcome.html` to change `Hello, World!` to something else.

2. Go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) where you should see the change without reloading.
