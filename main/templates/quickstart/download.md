1. Clone the gae-init app repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init.git hello
    ```

2. Then go to the directory that contains the sample code:

    ```
    cd hello
    ```

3. Finally install the third party dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

Alternatively, you can [download the project](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/archive/master.zip) as a zip file and extract it into a directory named `hello`.
