Test the application using Gulp which is one of the requiremtns and a wrapper for the Cloud SDK.

1. Start the web server with the following command from the root directory of `hello`:

    ```
    gulp
    ```

   The web server is now running, listening for requests on port 8080.

2. Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your web browser to see the app in action.

For more information about the supported commands run `gulp help`.
